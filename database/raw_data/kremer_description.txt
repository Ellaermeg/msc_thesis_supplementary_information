Columns:

isolate.code = numerical identification code, used in Thomas et al. 2012, 2016
curve.code = numerical code indicating unique growth rate curves (some isolates were measured more than once), also used in Thomas et al. 2012, 2016.
genus = genus name
species = species name
name = genus + species name
group = functional group identity (Greens, Diatoms, Cyanobacteria, Dinoflagellates)
environment = environment isolate was collected from (marine, freshwater)
temperature = growth temperature (degrees Celsius)
inv.kT = inverse temperature scaled by Boltzmann’s constant
r = specific growth rate (day^-1)
ln.r = natural log of specific growth rate
ln.rM = natural log of mass-corrected specific growth rate
ln.rT = natural log of temperature-corrected specific growth rate
bv = log10(biovolume, cubic micrometers)
ln.m = natural log of cell mass (micrograms carbon)
wts = weighting used for each growth rate observation in quantile regression analyses, based on number of points in each growth rate curve (see main text)
colors = color code used for plotting each functional group
symbol = symbol code used for plotting each functional group
mte.analysis = indicator variable - 1 = used in MTE analysis, 0 = not used.
